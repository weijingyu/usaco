## ![Dr. Cow](/0.0/images/cowhead2.gif) Submitting Solutions

The USACO Training Program features an automatic grading system for your homework problems. You submit your programs from the problem page itself; they are compiled and graded; the results are conveyed back to you -- all within a few seconds.

C/C++/C++11, PASCAL and Java are available. This system uses the GNU GCC compilation suite for C/C++/C++11 programs and the Free Pascal system for Pascal programs. The Java compiler is gjc as tis is written and is soon to be upgraded.

The grading system compilers are those often used at the IOI (though Java is note used at the international championships).

These newer compilers uses 32 bit int's; the Borland compilers use 16 bit int's. DO NOT GET IN TROUBLE BECAUSE OF THIS!

Submit solutions via theweb by typing the name of the file containing the source code into the 'Submit a file:' box at the bottome of problem description pages.

Program submissions require simple ** Header comments **: your ID (i.e. your USACO login name), the name of the porgram (which will be given in each porgramming assignment), and the language used. See the examples below to get the idea.

Every training page problem has input and output. Currently, the input appears in a file named 'probname.in' (e.g., if the problem name is 'ride', then the input filename is 'ride.in'). Output must be written to a file nmaed 'probname.out' (i.e., 'ride.out' for the 'ride' problem).
